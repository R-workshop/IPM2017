We have 2 population
========================================================

``` {r}
mu1 = 0
mu2 = 0
sd1 = 1
sd2 = 1
```

We take some random samples
========================================================
```{r}
x1 = rnorm(10, mean = mu1, sd=sd1)
x2 = rnorm(10, mean = mu2, sd=sd2)
```

Box plot will be
================
```{r}
boxplot(x1,x2)
```

Are the means equal?
================

$$ \mu_1 = \mu_2$$

$$ \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$$

```{r}
mean(x1)
mean(x2)
```
*In respect to what?*

t
================
We define $t$ as
$$t =  \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{SE_{\mu_1 - \mu_2}}$$

Now the problem is how to calculate $SE_{\mu_1 - \mu_2}$.

If $C = A - B$ and $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $\sigma_C^2 = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2$; therefore, 
$$SE_{\mu_1-\mu_2} = \sqrt{(\frac{\sigma_1^2}{N_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{N_2})}$$



t-test
======
```{r}
t.test(x1,x2)
```

t-test
======
```{r}
mu1 = 0; mu2 = 1; 
sd1 = 1; sd2 = 1
x1 = rnorm(30, mean = mu1, sd=sd1)
x2 = rnorm(30, mean = mu2, sd=sd2)
t.test(x1,x2)
```

Paired samples
==============
We have measured the blood glucose level of some patients before and after drug administraino. 
We want to see if the drug has any effects. 

*the condition of independence is not true any more*

Paired samples
==============
If $C = A - B$ and $A$ and $B$ correlates, then 

$$\sigma_c^2 = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 - 2 covar(A,B)$$

```{r}
mu1 = 0; mu2 = 1; 
sd1 = 1; sd2 = 1
x1 = rnorm(20, mean = mu1, sd=sd1)
x2 = x1 + rnorm(20, mean = mu2, sd=sd2)
```

Paired samples
==============
```{r}
t.test(x1,x2)
```

Paired samples
==============
```{r}
t.test(x1,x2, paired = T)
```
